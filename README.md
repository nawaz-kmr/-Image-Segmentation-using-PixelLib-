# Image-Segmentation-using-PixelLib

Pixellib is a library for performing segmentation of objects in images and videos. It supports the two major types of image segmentation:

1.Semantic segmentation

2.Instance segmentation

PixelLib supports two deep learning libraries for image segmentation which are Pytorch and Tensorflow.


PixelLib uses object segmentation to perform excellent foreground and background separation. It makes possible to alter the background of any image and video using just five lines of code.

Image segmentation is implemented with PixelLib by using Mask R-CNN model trained on coco dataset.
